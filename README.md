# MachineLearning-Hand-Tracker
Hello this is one of my Machine Learning project which i  took some time to do, is built and composed of primarily python and includes some libraries like cv2, mediapipe and OpenCV.
# Eplanation

Basically it is simple and easy to use, just open a  virutal env and , well you might have to make some configurations  python -m pip install "kivy[base]" kivy_examples --no-binary kivy  and pip install opencv-python. The your good to go

# How it Works
 Simple when the pips are installed you just run the complier, it would then open your camera, and if you put any hand or both hand within range of your camera it would relat a  map of it
